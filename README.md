# COLLADA Robots Collection

A collection of COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) robot models.

#### File extensions

The Collada format has two file types: `.dae` and `.zae`.

`.dae` files are XML files that do not contain included graphics or other binary data.

`.zae` files are compressed archives containing a `.dae` file and the necessary textures, graphics, and other files to render the `.dae` file properly.
A `.zae` file is simply a `.zip` archive that, in addition to other files, optionally contains a `manifest.xml` file.
